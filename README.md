## What Was Done

- **Identified fixed-width elements and layout issues** in the existing HTML and CSS.
- **Added responsive CSS rules** using media queries to ensure the website displays well on devices of all sizes, especially mobile phones and tablets.
- **Stacked columns vertically** and adjusted padding/gaps for smaller screens.
- **Modified the navigation menu** to stack links vertically on mobile viewports.
- **Ensured images are fluid** and scale within their containers using `max-width: 100%` and related properties.
- **Tested and fixed any overflow or scrolling issues** using Chrome DevTools’ device toolbar.

## Result

The site now adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, providing an accessible and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
